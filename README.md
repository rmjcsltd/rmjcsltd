Hello :wave:. It's about time I had a better example of what I can do than the miscellaneous SQL scripts on my [website](https://www.rmjcs.com). 

Take a look at the [Simonish](../../../Simonish) repo - an Android game built from scratch using Xamarin Forms - not that I want to do mobile development, it's just an interesting bit of lockdown learning.

At some point I'll make the Ewing repo public - a much more interesting piece of work to create a simple, lightweight job runner (think AutoSys, but much smaller).

Take care,

Rhys
